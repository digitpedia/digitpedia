# Digitpedia
Development of a personal finance blog and news service.

Here I will be sharing information about the website and how it progresses over time. It is mainly for personal records and to try and avoid any problems with the website.

Basic details: The website is published in English language only. It focuses on the UK market but lots of content is suitable for people around the world. It is powered by Wordpress.
> The aim of DigitPedia is to give people the best advice on the web about making money and saving money as well as details about the latest events in the personal finance sector.
Here is a screenshot of the [DigitPedia website](https://www.digitpedia.com/) taken in February 2017.

The web design and all round social branding feature the use of emoji's to make it feel fun and lighthearted. :smile: Finance doesn't always have to be serious. :thumbsup:

This GitHub will be used to keep important updates over time.

## Wider Community ##
There are also social profiles owned to increase the reach of the brand and hopefully help it's development. They are listed here, this isn't every web property but it is the main ones.
